# View Your AR Model

This repository contains a platform for you to view your 3D models in AR on your phone.
To upload, an account is required, so create one if you don't have one already.
It's also possible to clone the project and view it on your own local host if you prefer so.

## Your 3D Model

Make sure to export your 3D model to the .gltf fileformat and for clarity give it your own name so it's easy to keep track of.
Because web browsers work with limited memory make sure your model does not exceed 15MB at the very most; the smaller, the smoother the AR experience.

## Uploading Your Own Model

A few steps are required:

- Forking the project
- Upload 3D model

### Forking the project

![](images/fork.jpg)
Press the fork button and then Create Fork, you should now see "YourUsername/Makeathon".
By forking the project you create your own copy to work in which later can be added to the main project.

### Upload 3D model

![](images/uploadModel.jpg)
Click on the models folder, here you should find all other .gltf files already uploaded.
Click Add file > Upload files.
Here you can drag and drop your 3D file, press Commit changes when you're done.
Navigate back to the models folder and you should see your model in there.
