# View Your AR Model

This repository contains a platform for you to view your 3D models in AR on your phone.
To upload, an account is required, so create one if you don't have one already.
It's also possible to clone the project and view it on your own local host if you prefer so.

## Your 3D Model

Make sure to export your 3D model to the .gltf fileformat.
Because web browsers work with limited memory make sure your model does not exceed 15MB at the very most; the smaller, the smoother the AR experience.

## Uploading Your Own Model

A few steps are required:

- Forking the project
